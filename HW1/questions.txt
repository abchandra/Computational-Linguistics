HW 1 questions

Part 1

Q1)	error type 1:
	Misparsed:DIHS+RAHPTS as DIH+SRAHPTS
	Misparsed:MIHS+FAYL as MIH+SFAYL
	
	error type 2:
	Misparsed:POWST+WAOR as POW+STWAOR
	Misparsed:MAOR+OW+VER as MAO+ROW+VER

Q2)	The errors in type 1 are because our principal of putting [S] with the
	following syllable does not work. Here, the principle itself
	does not apply (or at least, needs additional conditions).

	The errors in type 2 are using the maximal onset principle, but here
	the pronounciation is influenced by the fact that postwar and moreover
	are compound words, and are effectively pronounced as post + war and
	more + over. So, the maximal onset principle isn't the best guiding
	principle for deciding where the onset should begin.


Q3)	For errors of type 1, we can add other heuristics/conditions that work
	in tandem with the [S] principal. Eg) with certain nuclei (like AH and
	IH) the [S] should be in the coda of that syllable.

	For errors of type 2, we could use a dictionary of english words to
	try to determine when not to use onset maximization. We can then split
	the compound word and syllabify them separately, and then connect the
	syllabified parts by a +.

Q4)	Extra Credit :
	for test.txt:
	syllable level accuracy is	0.970909
	word level accuracy is		0.963964

	Extra Credit 'improvements':

	Note, except for heuristic 1, the others do not always hold. They hold 
	more often than not, at least for our test data.

	Heuristic 1:
	for a CCC onset, the first C must be [S], the next in [P,T,K] and the 
	last in [W,J,R,L]. Moreover, if the third C is W, the the first two CC 
	must be [S,K]. Source:

	Heuristic 2:
	for certain nuclei (IH,AH,EH etc) that are followed by an [S], put [S] 
	inthe coda of the same syllable

	Heuristic 3:
	for certain nuclei (same as above) that are followed by [K,T,CH] 
	followed by [S], put them all in the coda of the same syllable.

	Heuristic 4:
	for the "-ly" suffix, [LIY], put them in their own syllable 
	
Part 2
Q1)	The first syllable types attempted are (relative frequencies for
	month 13):
		Charlotte	Georgia
	- V	47.96		26.67 
	- CVC	47.96		20.00
	- CV	4.08		23.33
	- CCVC	0.00		30.00
	
	For syllables attempted later, we compare the 13 and 21 month files 
	(20 for Georgia) against the last files. The syllable types with highest 
	percentage increase are noted below.
	
	Charlotte:
		month 48	month 21 
	- CCVC	30.66 		1.94	
	- VC	9.46		1.46
	- CCV	2.58		0.73
	- CVCC	7.10		2.19
	- CVCCC 0.43		0
	
	Georgia
		month 43	month 20
	- VC	8.04		2.74
	- VCC	2.50		1.37
	- CVCCC 0.54		0
	

Q2)		Charlotte	Georgia
	- V	48.45		25.00 
	- CVC	1.03		3.12
	- CV	50.52		71.88

	Charlotte(actual):
		month 48	month 21 
	- CCVC	1.54 		0.65	
	- VC	6.59		3.23
	- CCV	2.42		0.65
	- CVCCC 0.66		0
	- VCC 	0.88		0

	Georgia (actual):
		month 43	month 20
	- VC	9.73		2.08
	- VCC	0.34		0
	- CVCCC 0.34		0
	- CCV 	1.02		0
	- CVCC 	3.41		0
	- CVC   28.33		6.25

Q3)	The syllables CV and CVC are highly over-represented for both 
	Charlotte and Georgia. VC syllables are somewhat over-represented
	as well.  The syllables CVCC, CVCCC, VCC, CCV are all 
	underrepresented.  

Q4/5) 	As the background suggests, children acquire more marked/complex
	syllables later. The easiest ones,V and CV are acquired earliest,
	followed by the more marked VC and CVC. The most marked ones,
	such as CVCC are the latest to start being pronounced.
	
	CVCCC => CVC => CV (right most is least marked, and more represented)
	
	Thus, there is a strongly positive relation between the Implicational
	universals and the syllables which children start pronouncing first.
	
	However, CCV is something of an exception. CCV, which is not as 
	marked, is also underrepresented (comparable to CVCCC, and more
	underrepresented than CVCC). Perhaps this suggests that consonant 
	clusters in general are harder for children to pronounce, especially
	in the onset.
